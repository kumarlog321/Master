# StudentThesis_CamExtCalib

This project is to calibrate the camera extrinsically wrt. vehicle coordinate system using a fiducial marker system and an external camera. 

- Use case: calibrating the camera extrinsic wrt. vehicle coordinate system
- Motivation: extrinsic calibration is challenging and time-costly, such method may improve the quality in calibration and reduce the calibration time
- Using the external camera (nano or better optics), and/or aruco system is proposed for this study, but not limited. 
- Budget -> 1000 â‚¬ maybe <-> internal project (needs to be discussed with Heiko Ruth) <-> free to define the setup (pose of external cameras and markers)
- What is the expected accuracy? -> the study is to investigate accuracy and possible issues depending on the optics and develop the framework for the extrinsic calibration
- Currently with the cameras. Future work can be extended to the other sensors e.g. LiDAR  
- First in simulation for the proof of concept, then laboratory (easy setup on the desk or in a room), then ideally the test in the vehicle
